#### **Available Services**

| Service      | Description                                 | URL                                  |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Traefik**  | Reverse proxy and load balancer            | [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (dashboard) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL database for game data          | `localhost:5432` (PostgreSQL client) |
| **Backend**  | Game backend API server                   | [http://localhost/api](http://localhost/api) |
| **Frontend** | Game user interface                       | [http://localhost](http://localhost) |

---

#### **Database Access**

If you need to connect to the PostgreSQL database:

- **Host:** `localhost`
- **Port:** `5432`
- **Username:** `postgres`
- **Password:** `postgres`
- **Database:** `wizardwarriors`

#### Example Connection Command:

```bash
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d wizardwarriors
```

#### Modify Environment Variables

You can update the following environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:

- **Frontend:**
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: URL for the backend API (default: `http://localhost`)
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`: URL for the WebSocket server (default: `ws://localhost/game`)

- **Backend:**
  - `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for PostgreSQL
  - `REDIS_URL`: Connection string for Redis

**Note:** Both frontend and backend are served from the same domain (`localhost`) to ensure cookies work properly. Traefik routes requests to `/api`, `/game`, and `/healthcheck` to the backend, while all other requests go to the frontend.
